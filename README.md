# PC-Part Detector

## Overview

This PC-Part Detection Project aims to recognize and categorize different PC parts using object detection algorithms. This project processes a camera feed, applies image processing techniques, and leverages object detection to identify and sort various PC parts accurately. The primary use case for this project is to facilitate the sorting of PC components, such as hard drives (HDD), solid-state drives (SSD), and random-access memory (RAM), within a recycling facility or similar environment.

## Features

- Object Detection: The project utilizes object detection algorithms to identify and locate different PC parts within the camera feed.
- Classification: PC components are classified into categories such as HDD, SSD, and RAM based on their appearance.
- Real-time Processing: The system processes a live camera feed in real-time, making it suitable for use in industrial settings.

## Prerequisites

- Python
- OpenCV
